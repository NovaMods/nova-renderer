# How to contribute
Here's some guidelines for contributing to the Nova Renderer

## Making Changes
The procedure for actually contributing is fairly simple:
* Fork the Nova Renderer
* Create a feature branch for whatever feature you want to change or bug you want to fix
* Make your changes. Test them to make sure that they work as intended
* Make sure that you adhere to our [style guide](https://github.com/DethRaid/nova-renderer/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines)
* Create a pull request merging your feature branch into master
  * If you're fixing a bug, reference the issue that the bug was first reported in somewhere in your pull request
* I'll either approve your changes or let you know if there's any problems.
